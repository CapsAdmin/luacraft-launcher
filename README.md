Launch editor.bat or src/linux/ide.bash to get started. From there you will be greeted with a tutorial (in Norwegian at the moment)

The IDE used is [ZeroBrane](https://github.com/pkulchenko/ZeroBraneStudio/) and it has been customized with plugins for this development environment. The first time you press start it will download and build everything needed. This can take some time depending on your computer.
